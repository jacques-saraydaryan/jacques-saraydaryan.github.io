The following works compare different crowd navigation strategies. The work focuses on Deep-RL technics. 
To do so the [crowNav](https://github.com/Shuijing725/CrowdNav_DSRNN) simulator has been used and some [improvements](https://github.com/michelland/DSRNN) made to add more realistic hypotheses.
The [DS-RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04820) deep-RL has been used as baseline and improve to fit new conditions.
