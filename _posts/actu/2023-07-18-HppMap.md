title: RCS 2023 - Human Presence Probability Map (HPP): a Probability propagation based on Human Flow Grid
description: > 
To deal with the learned model and the real time robot observations, we propose to include a gaussian rotation probability process (VonMises) combined with the previous learned observation to adapt the propagation. 
A set of experiments has been conduced with simulated environments that include real data allowing us to evaluate the model and to compare with the standard approaches.
